# Task-management-app-using-Python-Flask

## Introduction
#### This project introduced me to the fundamental concepts and tools used in web development with Flask, including routing, templates, and database management. I learned how to use these tools to create a basic web application that can handle HTTP requests, generate dynamic HTML pages, and store and retrieve data from a database. I also learned how to use WTForms to create and validate forms, which is a useful skill for building user-friendly web applications. Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in web development with Flask.
